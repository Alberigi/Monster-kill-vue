![Monster Kill Vue](https://github.com/Alberigi/Monster-kill-vue/blob/main/screenshot.png)

This is my first Vue.js application, built with Vue 2. It is a simple game where you simulate a duel between a player and a monster.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Launch the game by running `npm run serve`.
4. Open the game in your browser.

## Game Instructions

- The game consists of two main characters: the player and the monster.
- Each character has a life bar indicating their current health.
- The player's life bar is displayed in blue, and the monster's life bar is displayed in red.
- The goal of the game is to defeat the monster by reducing its life to zero before the player's life reaches zero.
- Use the available buttons to perform different actions:
  - **Attack**: Inflict damage to the monster.
  - **Special Attack**: Perform a more powerful attack.
  - **Heal**: Restore some of the player's health.
  - **Give Up**: Surrender and end the game.
- The game logs each action taken, displaying the damage dealt or health restored.
